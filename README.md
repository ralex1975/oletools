[oletools](http://www.decalage.info/python/oletools) is a package of python tools to analyze
[Microsoft OLE2 files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_File_Binary_Format) 
(also called Structured Storage, Compound File Binary Format or Compound Document File Format), 
such as Microsoft Office documents or Outlook messages, mainly for malware analysis, forensics and debugging. 
It is based on the [olefile](http://www.decalage.info/olefile) parser. 
See [http://www.decalage.info/python/oletools](http://www.decalage.info/python/oletools) for more info.

Tools:
------

### Tools to analyze malicious documents

- [oleid](https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/wiki/oleid): to analyze OLE files to detect specific characteristics usually found in malicious files.
- [olevba](https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/wiki/olevba): to extract and analyze VBA Macro source code from MS Office documents (OLE and OpenXML).
- [MacroRaptor](https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/wiki/mraptor): to detect malicious VBA Macros
- [msodde](https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/wiki/msodde): to detect and extract DDE/DDEAUTO links from MS Office documents, RTF and CSV
- [pyxswf](https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/wiki/pyxswf): to detect, extract and analyze Flash objects (SWF) that may
  be embedded in files such as MS Office documents (e.g. Word, Excel) and RTF,
  which is especially useful for malware analysis.
- [oleobj](https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/wiki/oleobj): to extract embedded objects from OLE files.
- [rtfobj](https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/wiki/rtfobj): to extract embedded objects from RTF files.

### Tools to analyze the structure of OLE files

- [olebrowse](https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/wiki/olebrowse): A simple GUI to browse OLE files (e.g. MS Word, Excel, Powerpoint documents), to
  view and extract individual data streams.
- [olemeta](https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/wiki/olemeta): to extract all standard properties (metadata) from OLE files.
- [oletimes](https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/wiki/oletimes): to extract creation and modification timestamps of all streams and storages.
- [oledir](https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/wiki/oledir): to display all the directory entries of an OLE file, including free and orphaned entries.
- [olemap](https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/wiki/olemap): to display a map of all the sectors in an OLE file.

Download and Install:
---------------------

The recommended way to download and install/update the **latest stable release**
of oletools is to use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/):

- On Linux/Mac: `sudo -H pip install -U oletools`
- On Windows: `pip install -U oletools`

This should automatically create command-line scripts to run each tool from
any directory: `olevba`, `mraptor`, `rtfobj`, etc.

To get the **latest development version** instead:

- On Linux/Mac: `sudo -H pip install -U https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/archive/master.zip`
- On Windows: `pip install -U https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/archive/master.zip`

See the [documentation](https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/wiki/Install)
for other installation options.
